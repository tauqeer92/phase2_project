# Method Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

We're taking a string and counting how many words in that string

## 2. Design the Method Signature

count_words('Hello World') => 2 



## 3. Create Examples as Tests

count_words('') => 0
count_words('Hello') => 1
count_words('Hello World') => 2
count_words(' Hello World') => 2

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
